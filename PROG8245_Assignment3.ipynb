    "The Modified TF-Modified IDF technique can be useful, but it has its pros and cons. Here's a simple breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "Takes Document Length Into Account: By adjusting for document length, it ensures that longer documents don't unfairly boost term weights. This is useful when dealing with datasets where documents vary in size.\n",
    "Considers Term Position: Giving higher weight to terms that appear earlier in the document can capture important keywords that influence the document's topic or meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "Complexity: It adds complexity compared to standard TF-IDF. This could be unnecessary if document length or term position isn’t a key factor for your analysis.\n",
    "Less Effective for Short Texts: For short documents (like tweets or short reviews), this method might not add significant value and could overemphasize certain words or positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "It’s a good technique if you're working with documents of varying lengths and want to prioritize terms that appear early. However, it might be overkill in simpler or more uniform datasets."
